substeps-scala-core
===================

TODO
----

* Tests that tags are used by features (filter scenarios)
* Non fatal tags - or is this part of the runner? could just report which ones failed. - Defnitely runner only
* Report builders - needs to be a separate module
* Addhoc substep replacement (would be good for plugins)
