substeps-scala-core
===================

TODO
----

* Tags
* Non fatal tags - or is this part of the runner? could just report which ones failed.
* Report builders - needs to be a separate module
* Logging - events?
* before and after classes for step implementations
* Backgrounds
* Addhoc substep replacement (would be good for plugins)
